Sample model:



const mongoose=require('mongoose')


const bookSchema= new mongoose.Schema({
   bookName: {
       type: String,
       required: true
   },
   ISBN: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true
   },
   author: String,
   tags: [ String ], //array of strings
   year: Number,
   isPublished: {
       type: Boolean, //Boolean
       default: false
   },
   prices: {
       indianPrice: String,
       europeanPrice: String,
       japanPrice: String
   },
   sales: {
       type: Number,
       default : 0
   },
   completionDate: Date


}, {timestamps: true} )


module.exports = mongoose.model( 'Book', bookSchema )




Assignment:

Create a books collection in your DB ( using bookModel with following fields)- *bookName( mandatory field), price containing Indian and european price, year ( should be 2021 if no year is provided) , tags array, authorName, totalPages , stockAvailable ( true false)*

create the following API’s (write logic in bookController and routes in routes):

createBook : to create a new entry..use this api to create 11+ entries in your collection

bookList : gives all the books- their bookName and authorName only

getBooksInYear: takes year as input in post request and gives list of all books published that year

getParticularBooks:- (this is a good one, make sincere effort to solve this) take any input and use it as a condition to fetch books that satisfy that condition 	
e.g if body had { name: “hi”} then you would fetch the books with this name
if body had { year: 2020} then you would fetch the books with this name
hence the condition will differ based on what you input in the request body

getXINRBooks- request to return all books who have an Indian price tag of “100INR” or “200INR” or “500INR”

getRandomBooks - returns books that are available in stock or have more than 500 pages 



Hints / Solutions:
createBook : 
BookModel.create(book)
bookList :  
BookModel.find().select({ bookName:1, authorName:1})
getBooksInYear: 
find( { year: req.body.year } )
getParticularBooks:-  
BookModel.find( req.body ) 
//this will be sufficient as whatever condition we receive in the body of POST request , we can pass that same condition as JSON filter in the find query 
getXINRBooks-
BookModel.find({ 'prices.indianPrice' : {$in: ["100INR", "200INR", "500INR"] } } )
getRandomBooks - 
BookModel.find({ $or: [ {stockAvailable: true} , { totalPages: {$gt: 500} }   ] } )
